        DESCRIPTION             
                "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those
                devices operating as Central controllers, that
                terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol
                tunnel from Cisco Light-weight LWAPP Access Points.

                Network management stations learn the audio/video
                traffic quality observed on WLANs through this MIB.

                The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs
                can be depicted as follows:

                The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
                the APs.  The MNs communicate with the APs through
                the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.

                LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
                controllers and the controller pushes the configuration,
                that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs.
                The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
                wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
                the LWAPP frames to the controller.

                This MIB provides the information about the per-client
                /per-AP packet latency, packet jitter, packet loss and
                roaming time in the network which does affect quality 
                of audio/video traffic. These parameters are called 
                Traffic Stream Metrics. When TSM collection is enabled 
                on all 802.11a/802.11b interfaces, the metrics are 
                collected by controller from AP in every 90 seconds 
                window.

		Information provided by this MIB can be used by the
                NMS applications to present measurements of audio and 
                video traffic quality. 

                                   GLOSSARY

                Access Point ( AP )

                An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
                control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
                and provides access to the distribution services via
                the wireless medium for associated clients.

                LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
                LWAPP frames and sends it to the controller to which
                it is logically connected.

                Central Controller ( CC )

                The central entity that terminates the LWAPP protocol
                tunnel from the LWAPP APs.  Throughout this MIB,
                this entity is also referred to as 'controller'.

                Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP )

                This is a generic protocol that defines the
                communication between the Access Points and the
                Central Controller.

                Mobile Node ( MN )

                A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
                network associated with an access point.

                Traffic Stream Metrics (TSM)
 
                These  are parameters like the per-client / per-AP
                packet latency, packet jitter, packet loss and roaming
                time in the network, which does affect quality of
                audio/video traffic.  These statistics are collected
                to study and characterize the pattern of data
                traffic and perform appropriate management tasks to
                regulate the same for the smooth functioning of the
                network.

        DESCRIPTION 
                "This table represents the statistics received by the
                controller from the associated APs, on the uplink 
                traffic ( traffic from the 802.11 wireless client to 
                the AP ) observed on the dot11 interfaces of the 
                respective APs.
 
                For example, suppose a client with address 
                12:3f:73:99:de:5b connects to the 802.11 radio 
                interface, 13:13:43:de:bb:ff of an AP at 18:30:00 hours.

                Assuming that cLTsmDot11aConfig (or cLTsmDot11bConfig) 
                is set to 'true' for the respective type of interface, 
                every 90 seconds, AP sends the controller statistical
                data for the client 12:3f:73:99:de:5b associated at the
                interface 13:13:43:de:bb:ff.

                So, after 3 minutes, i.e., 180 seconds, controller would 
                have received statistics for the particular client and 
                AP combination twice leading to two rows in this table
                as follows.

                1> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b  
                             Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff  Time: 18:33:00 

                2> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b  
                             Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff  Time: 18:31:30 
    
                Now assume that, at 18:33:00, the client moves and 
                associates with another AP associated to the same
                controller, at the AP's 802.11 interface 
                14:14:43:de:dd:ee.

                After 3 minutes, i.e., 180 seconds (say), controller 
                would have again received statistics from the AP, for
                the particular client and new AP combination twice
                leading to two new rows in this table.

                At this point, this table will have entries with 
                following references :

                1> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b  
                           Interface:14:14:43:de:dd:ee  Time: 18:36:00 

                2> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b  
                           Interface:14:14:43:de:dd:ee  Time: 18:34:30

                3> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b  
                           Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff  Time: 18:33:00 

                4> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b  
                           Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff  Time: 18:31:30

                The maximum number of entries in this table is
                indicated by cLTsmDot11MaxTsmStatsEntries.  When

cLTsmDot11DnlinkTable OBJECT-TYPE
        SYNTAX     SEQUENCE OF CLTsmDot11DnlinkEntry
        MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
        STATUS     current
        DESCRIPTION 
                "This table represents the statistics received by the
                controller from the associated APs, on the downlink
                traffic ( traffic from the AP to the 802.11 wireless
                client ) observed on the dot11 interfaces of the 
                respective APs.

                For example, suppose a client with address 
                12:3f:73:99:de:5b connects to the 802.11 radio 
                interface, 13:13:43:de:bb:ff of an AP at 18:30:00 hours.

                Assuming that cLTsmDot11aConfig (or cLTsmDot11bConfig) 
                is set to 'true' for the respective type of interface, 
                every 90 seconds, the AP sends the controller
                statistical data about the 12:3f:73:99:de:5b associated
                at the interface 13:13:43:de:bb:ff.

                So, after 3 minutes, i.e., 180 seconds, controller would 
                have received statistics from the AP for the particular
                client and AP combination twice leading to two rows in
                this table as follows.

                1> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b  
                             Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff  Time: 18:33:00 

                2> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b  
                             Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff  Time: 18:31:30 
    
                Now assume that, at 18:33:00, the client moves and 
                associates with another AP associated to the same
                controller, at the AP's 802.11 interface 
                14:14:43:de:dd:ee.

                After 3 minutes, i.e., 180 seconds (say), controller 
                would have again collected statistics for the particular 
                client and new AP combination twice leading to two new 
                rows in this table.

                At this point, this table will have entries as
                follows.

                1> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b  
                           Interface:14:14:43:de:dd:ee  Time: 18:36:00 

                2> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b  
                           Interface:14:14:43:de:dd:ee  Time: 18:34:30

                3> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b  
                           Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff  Time: 18:33:00 

                4> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b  
                           Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff  Time: 18:31:30

                The maximum number of entries in this table is
                indicated by cLTsmDot11MaxTsmStatsEntries.  When
                the specified limit of entries is reached the oldest
                entries will be removed to make room for new entries.
                However, the controller may remove the entries if it
