    DESCRIPTION
        "A Textual Convention that represents a type of target.

         genIf(1)    A target of type interface defined by 
                     CcbptTargetIdIf Textual Convention.

         atmPvc(2)   A target of type ATM PVC defined 
                     by the CcbptTargetIdAtmPvc Textual Convention.

         frDlci(3)   A target of type Frame Relay DLCI 
                     defined by the CcbptTargetIdFrDlci Textual 
                     Convention.

         entity(4) A target of type entity defined by the 
                   CcbptTargetIdEntity Textual Convention.  This target
                   type is used to indicate the attachment of a Class 
                   Based Policy to a physical entity.

    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Denotes a generic target ID.

         A CcbptTargetId value is always interpreted within the 
         context of an CcbptTargetType value. Every usage of the 
         CcbptTargetId Textual Convention is required to specify the
         CcbptTargetType object which provides the context. It is 
         suggested that the CcbptTargetType object is logically 
         registered before the object(s) which use the CcbptTargetId
         Textual Convention if they appear in the same logical row.

         The value of an CcbptTargetId object must always be
         consistent with the value of the associated CcbptTargetType
         object. Attempts to set a CcbptTargetId object to a value
         which is inconsistent with the associated targetType
         must fail with an inconsistentValue error.

-- Type Specific Target ID definitions
-- 
-- NOTE:  Some or all of the target ID definitions may be unused 
--        in actual object definitions. However, since they 
--        unambiguously illustrate the format of each type of target
--        ID, the definitions corresponding to each possible value of
--        CcbptTargetType are included.
