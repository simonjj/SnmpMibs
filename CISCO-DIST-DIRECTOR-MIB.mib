    DESCRIPTION
        "Cisco Distributed Director MIB.

        The Cisco Distributed Director provides global Internet
        scalability and increased performance as seen by end
        users while reducing transmission costs and maximizing
        end-to-end access performance as seen by clients.

        The Cisco Distributed Director provides the ability to
        perform load distribution in a sophisticated manner that
        takes server availability, relative client-to-server
        topological proximities ('distances'), server load, and
        client-to-server link latency into account to determine
        the 'best' server. Having these provisions means that
        users need only a single subdomain name or Universal
        Resource Locator(URL)-embedded hostname for accessing a
        distributed set of servers. This eliminates the need for
        end-users to choose a server from a list of possible
        sites. The Cisco Distributed Director leverages the
        intelligence in the network to automatically,
        dynamically, and efficiently pick the 'best' server for
        the user, using a single hostname or DNS subdomain name.

        This MIB specification contains definitions of
        management information of the Distributed Director that
        can be remotely monitored and controlled. The
        information includes various statistics, configurations
        and status of Distributed Director.

        Some acronyms and terminologies used in this MIB, which
        may not be readily understood are defined below.

-- Textual Conventions

CddMetricType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS  current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention defines metric types in the DD.
        There are many criteria which the DD system can use
        when sorting a list of IP addresses. In order to
        collect all of the information used for sorting, the DD
        system can use one or many of the different 'metrics'
        it has built in. Once a set of metrics are selected and
        the information has been gathered, there are many
        different ways to put this information together and
        arrive at a sorted list. The currently available
        metrics are as follows.

        DRP external metric (drpExternal(1)):
        This metric is gathered by sending a Director Response
        Protocol (DRP) request to all DRP associated routers,
        asking them for the number of BGP 'hops' between them
        and the client originating the DNS/HTTP query/request.

        DRP internal metric (drpInternal(2)):
        This metric is gathered by sending a DRP request to all
        DRP associated routers, asking them for the distance
        from themselves to the edge of their BGP AS in the
        direction of the client originating the DNS/HTTP
        query/request.

        DRP server metric (drpServer(3)):
        This metric is gathered by sending a DRP request to all
        DRP associated routers, asking them for the distance
        between themselves and their associated remote server.

        DRP RTT metric (drpRtt(4)):
        This metric is gathered by sending a DRP request to all
        DRP associated routers, asking them for the round-trip
        time between themselves and the client originating the
        DNS/HTTP query/request. This metric can be used to
        direct the client to the server that is likely to have
        a minimum link latency to the client.

        Administrative preference metric (admin(5)):
        This metric can be used in order to specify a simple
        preference of one server over another.

        Random metric (random(6)):
        This metric simply selects a random number for each IP
        address. If only this metric were used, it would result
        in selecting an IP address at random from the list.

        Portion metric (portion(7)):
        This metric enables users to assign a load portion to
        each server such that servers with a higher portion
        value will receive a larger percentage of connections
        at any one time. The Distributed Director uses these
        portion metric values to determine the percentage of
        the current number of requests to give to each server.

        DFP availability metric (dfpAvailability(8)):
        This metric enables the Director to make server
        selection based on server load. The DD obtains the
        server load information from all Dynamic Feedback
        Protocol (DFP) agents running on local server load
        balancers. Servers with less load will receive more
        connections from clients.

        Route map metric (routeMap(9)):
        This metric uses the Cisco route map mechanism to
        perform server selection based on the route from the
        servers to the client originating the DNS/HTTP
        query/request."

CddMetricPriority ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d"
    STATUS  current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention defines a priority level of
        a metric type. The priority is used by the Distributed
        Director to determine the order in which metrics are
        considered for selecting a server. The less the value,
        the higher the priority is. For example, the DRP
        external metric's priority has the value '1' and the
        random metric's priority has the value '2'. All
        potential server's DRP external metrics are compared
        first. If multiple servers have the same metric value,
        the random metrics would be compared next. If multiple
        metric types have the same priority value, the metrics
        are added to obtain a composite metric.

        If a metric's priority has the value of '0', the metric
        is not considered to determine the best server."
    SYNTAX  Unsigned32 (0..101)

CddMetricWeight ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d"
    STATUS  current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention defines a weight value for a
        metric type. When a metric type is referenced to
        determine the best server, the metric will always be
        multiplied by its weight.

        If a metric's weight has the value of '0', the metric
        is not considered to determine the best server."
    SYNTAX  Unsigned32 (0..100)

CddMetricProfileId ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d"
    STATUS  current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A unique value, greater than zero, which uniquely
        identifies a metric profile in the DD system. A metric
        profile contains priority and weight values for all
        metrics in the profile."
    SYNTAX  Unsigned32 (1..4294967295)

CddMetricProfileIdOrZero ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d"
    STATUS  current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention is an extension of the
        CddMetricProfileId convention. The latter defines a
        greater than zero value to identify a metric profile in
        the DD system. This extension permits the additional
        value of '0'. The value '0' is object-specific and must
        be defined as part of the description of any object
        which uses this syntax."
