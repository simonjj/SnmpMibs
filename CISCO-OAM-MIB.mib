    DESCRIPTION
            "A MIB module for invoking OAM loopback Ping on ATM

    DESCRIPTION
            "Removed the OwnerString TEXTUAL-CONVENTION and
             imported the same from RMON-MIB."
    REVISION        "200306270000Z"
    DESCRIPTION     
            "Add object to oamLoopbackPingTable: 
              - oamLoopbackPingMinRttuSec,   
              - oamLoopbackPingAvgRttuSec,

    REVISION        "200304040000Z"
    DESCRIPTION     
            "Add objects to oamLoopbackPingTable: 
              - oamLoopbackPingExecTime, 
              - oamLoopbackPingDir, 
              - oamLoopbackPingOperStatus 

             Add new table oamLoopbackSegEndPointTable for OAM segment
             endpoint provisioning.

             Usage of oamLoopbackSegEndPointTable:
               If the loopback ping test type (oamLoopbackPingType) is
               'segment', the test requires the endpoint under test
               and the remote ping endpoint are both OAM segment
               loopback endpoints.
                
               The table oamLoopbackSegEndPointTable is used to
               provision an ATM connection endpoint to be an OAM
               segment endpoint.
 
               If the endpoints are already OAM segment endpoints, the
               provisioning of the table is not required."

    SYNTAX     OamLoopbackPingEntry
    MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A OAM loopback request entry.

        A management station wishing to create an entry should
        first generate a pseudo-random serial number to be used
        as the index to this sparse table.  The NMS should
        then create the associated instance of the row status
        and row owner objects.  It must also, either in the same
        or in successive PDUs, create the associated instances
        specifying the VPI and VCI values.  It should also modify
        the default values for the other configuration objects
        if the defaults are not appropriate.

        Once the appropriate instance of all the configuration
        objects have been created, either by an explicit SNMP
        set request or by default, the row status should be set
        to active to initiate the request.  Note that this entire
        procedure may be initiated via a single set request which
        specifies a row status of createAndGo as well as specifies
        valid values for the non-defaulted configuration objects.

        Once the OAM sequence has been activated, it cannot be
        stopped -- it will run until the configured number of
        cells have been sent.

        Once the sequence completes, the management station should
        retrieve the values of the status objects of interest, and
        should then delete the entry.  In order to prevent old
        entries from clogging the table, entries will be aged out,
        but an entry will never be deleted within 5 minutes of
        completing."
