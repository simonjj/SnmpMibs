-- This MIB provides an extension to the CISCO-HSRP-MIB which defines Cisco's
-- "proprietary Hot Standby Routing Protocol (HSRP), defined in RFC2281. The
-- extensions cover assigning of secondary HSRP ip addresses, modifying an 
-- HSRP Group's priority by tracking the operational status of interfaces,
-- etc. 

-- Terminology:
-- HSRP is a protocol used amoung a group of routers for the purpose of 
-- selecting an "active router" and a "standby router". 

-- An "active router" is the router of choice for routing packets.

-- A "standby router" is a router that takes over the routing duties
-- when an active router fails, or when preset conditions have been met.

-- An "HSRP group" or a "standby group" is a set of routers which communicate 
-- using HSRP. An HSRP group has a group MAC address and a group IP address.
-- These are the designated addresses. The active router assumes  
-- (i.e. inherits) these group addresses.

-- BIA stands for Burned In Address.

	DESCRIPTION
                "The cHsrpExtIfTrackedEntry allows an HSRP group 
                interface to track one or more interfaces. Weight(priority)
                is given to each and every interface tracked. When a tracked 
                interface is unavailable, the HSRP priority of the router is 
                decreased. i.e cHsrpGrpPriority value assigned to an HSRP 
                group will reduce by the value assigned to
                cHsrpExtIfTrackedPriority. This reduces the likelihood 
                of a router with a failed key interface becoming the 
                active router.
                 
                Setting cHsrpExtIfTrackedRowStatus to active starts
                the tracking of cHsrpExtIfTracked by the HSRP group. 
                The value of cHsrpExtIfTrackedRowStatus may be set 
                to destroy at any time.

                Entries may not be created via SNMP without explicitly setting
                cHsrpExtIfTrackedRowStatus to either 'createAndGo' 
                or 'createAndWait'.

                Entries can be created and modified via the management
                protocol or by the device's local management interface.

                If the row is not active, and a local management interface
                command modifies that row, the row may transition to active
                state.

                A row entry in the cHsrpExtIfTrackedTable can not be created
                unless the corresponding row in the cHsrpGrpTable has been 
                created. If that corresponding row in cHsrpGrpTable is 
                deleted, the interfaces it tracks also get deleted.

                A row which is not in active state will timeout after a
                configurable period (five minutes by default). This timeout
                period can be changed by setting cHsrpConfigTimeout."

                Secondary addresses can be added by setting

                A row which is not in active state will timeout after a

                This is because a secondary ip address cannot be created
                unless the primary ip address has already been set.

                To create a new cHsrpExtSecAddrEntry row, a management
