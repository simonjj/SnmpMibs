               hot standby.  No longer used.

             nft(4)
               Network Fault Tolerance.  The logical adapter has two or more

               Transmit Load Balancing. Indicates that the logical adapter has

               transmits and receives, while the others only transmit.  If the

           "A count of frames received on a particular
            interface that are not an integral number of
            octets in length and do not pass the FCS check.
            The alignment of a frame is checked by the
            receiver after the packet has failed the
            Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC). Misaligned
            packets do not end on an 8-bit boundary.
            All packets contain a set number of bytes
            and must end after a defined number of bytes.
            Packets that do not end on a byte boundary
            fail the alignment check.

            Faulty components may be the cause of alignment
            errors. Check the following:

            Segment too long: Nodes at the far end of the
            cabling system transmit, unaware that a station
            at the other end has already gained control of
            the medium by transmitting the first 64 bytes
            of a frame.

            Failing cable: Packet data traveling through
            shorted or damaged cabling may become corrupt
            before reaching the destination station.

            Segment not grounded properly: Improper grounding
            of a segment may allow ground-induced noise to
            corrupt data flow.

            Improper termination: If a cable segment is not
            properly terminated, allowing the signal to be
            absorbed upon reaching the end of the segment,
            a partial signal will bounce back and collide
            with existing signals.

            Noisy cable: Interference or noise produced by
            motors or other devices can distort the signals
            and cause CRC/Alignment errors.

            Deaf/partially deaf node: A faulty station that
            cannot hear the activity is considered a deaf node.
            If you suspect a deaf node, replace the NIC.

            Failing repeater, transceiver, or controller:
            Repeaters, transceivers, and controllers can
            disrupt the network signal, transmit erroneous
            signals on the wire, or ignore incoming packets.
            Perform the following steps:

            1.  If your NIC is continuously transmitting,
                it causes erroneous signals, or 'jabber'.
                Replace a jabbering transmitter to ensure
                proper network performance.

            2.  Check your hub or switch. This component
                may be at fault.  Use the diagnostics from
                the component manufacturer to help you

             because the medium was busy.  Packets involved
             in any collisions are not counted.  Frames

             This statistic will be incremented often during

             Deferred transmissions occur when the network

             Deferred transmissions indicate that this segment

             Late collisions may be an indication that a
             segment is longer than allowed by the wiring
             specifications.

             A station will believe it has control of the
             cable segment if it has already transmitted 64
             bytes.  If another node at the far end of the
             segment has not yet seen the packet, and transmits,
             this packet will collide with the first
             transmission after the first 64 bytes have been
             sent.  Ensure that your segment length does not
             exceed the maximum length allowed.

             Because the location of cabling problems can be very
             difficult to detect on an Ethernet network, you may
             want to 'shorten' an Ethernet segment (remove portions
             of the network to isolate problems) until the problems
             are no longer seen, and then expand the network until
             the problem recurs.

             If this counter increments quickly in a short
             period of time, it may mean that the network
             card is running in half duplex mode, but your
             hub or switch port is configured for full duplex
             mode.  Compare your network card's configuration
             with the port's configuration.

             of a segment may allow ground-induced noise to
             corrupt data flow.

             Improper termination: If a cable segment is not
             properly terminated, allowing the signal to be
             absorbed upon reaching the end of the segment,
             a partial signal will bounce back and collide
             with existing signals.

             Noisy cable: Interference or noise produced by
             motors or other devices can distort the signals
             and cause CRC/Alignment errors.

             Deaf/partially deaf node: A faulty station that
             cannot hear the activity is considered a deaf node.
             If you suspect a deaf node, replace the NIC.

             Failing repeater, transceiver, or controller:
             Repeaters, transceivers, and controllers can
             disrupt the network signal, transmit erroneous
             signals on the wire, or ignore incoming packets.
             Perform the following steps:

             1.  If your NIC is continuously transmitting,
                 it causes erroneous signals, or 'jabber.'
                 Replace a jabbering transmitter to ensure
                 proper network performance.

             2.  Check your hub or switch. This component
                 may be at fault.  Use the diagnostics from
                 the component manufacturer to help you
                 determine if a problem exists."

            "The number of packets transmitted with carrier
             sense errors:  This counter contains the number
             of times that the carrier sense signal from the
             physical layer interface was not asserted or was
             de-asserted during transmission of a packet without
             collision.

             The carrier sense signal is an ongoing activity
             of a data station to detect whether or not another
             station is transmitting.  Carrier sense errors
             are detected when a station transmits a frame and
             does not detect its own signal on the wire.

             If you receive carrier sense errors, check the
             following:

             Failing cable: Packet data traveling through
             shorted or damaged cabling may cause a signal loss.
             Ensure that your cable is working and plugged in
             properly.

             Segment not grounded properly: Improper grounding
             of a segment may allow ground-induced noise to
             interrupt the signal.  Ensure that you have
             properly grounded all segments.

             Noisy cable: Interference or noise produced by
             motors or other devices can interrupt the signals.

             Deaf/partially deaf node: A faulty station that
             cannot hear the activity is considered a deaf node.
             If you suspect a deaf node, the network interface
             card should be replaced.

             Failing hub, switch, or controller: Repeaters,
             switches and controllers can disrupt the network
             signal, transmit erroneous signals on the wire,
             or ignore incoming packets.  Perform the following
             steps:

             1.  Swap out the adapter, adapter cable, and
                 adapter attachment point, one at a time.
                 If you find a faulty component, replace it.

             2.  If none of the items listed above help you
                 isolate the problem, you may need to replace
                 the switch or hub.  Use a network analyzer
                 to isolate the problem area."

             group has connectivity restored from a Failed condition.  The
             cpqNicConnectivityRestored trap is sent instead.

             This can be caused by replacement of a faulty cable
             or re-attaching a cable that was unplugged.

             at least one physical adapter remains in the OK condition..

             This can be caused by loss of link due to a cable being
             removed from the adapter or the Hub or Switch.  Internal
             adapter, Hub, or Switch failures can also cause this
             condition.

             User Action: Check the cables to the adapter and the Hub or
             Switch.  If no cable problems are found, the adapter, Hub,
             or Switch may need replacement."
