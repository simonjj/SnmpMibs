        DESCRIPTION
               "This MIB module manages the service-aware feature of
                Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN).

                This MIB is an enhancement of the CISCO-GGSN-MIB. 
          
                There needs to be a tight coupling between GGSN and CSG 
                in order to realize the enhanced GGSN, which is capable 
                of categorizing traffic flowing within a PDP context to
                different services.
  
                An enhanced version of Diameter Credit Control 
                Application (DCCA) will be used for implementing  
                real-time credit control of end users in the IPS 
                framework.  The GGSN will act as DCCA client and will 
                interact with DCCA server for quota negotiation and
                usage reporting.

                The credit control request (CCR) message is used between
                DCCA-Client (DCCA-C) and DCCA-Server to request credit 
                authorization for a given service.  The credit control 
                request has one mandatory AVP (Attribute Value Pair) 
                called CCR.  For a session based credit control 
                several interrogation required, the first, intermediate
                and final.  The first interrogation must be sent
                before the DCCA-C allows any service event to the 
                user, CCR type is set to INITIAL in this case.  When all
                the granted service units for one unit type are spent
                by the end user or the validity time is expired
                the DCCA-C must send a new credit control (CC) request
                to CC server, this is the intermediate interrogation
                and the CCR type AVP is set to the value UPDATE. 
                When the end user terminates a service session the 
                DCCA-C must send a final CCR request message to the 
                CC server.  The CCR type AVP is set to the FINAL 
                or TERMINATION_REQUSET. 
 
                CSG will be responsible for categorizing the traffic, 
                quota management activities and usage reporting 
                functions.  GGSN will act as a quota server for CSG. 
                A proprietary interface based on GTP' will be used 
                between GGSN and CSG.
