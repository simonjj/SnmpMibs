    DESCRIPTION
        "This management information module supports 
         configuration, control and monitoring of redundancy 
         protection for various kinds of components on 
         Cisco managed devices. 

         It is meant to be generic enough to handle basic 
         redundancy control and monitoring for many types of 
         redundant member components and redundancy architectures
         as long as there is an Entity MIB entPhysicalIndex and 
         entPhysicalVendorType assigned to each member component.

         It is designed so that the tables can be augmented in
         other extension MIBS which build upon this MIB by 
         adding additional objects that may be specific to a 
         particular type of redundancy or member component.

         This MIB can also be used in cases where some types of
         redundancy groups and members don't require explicit 
         user configuration. One example may be redundant fan
         assemblies. In those cases, the managed system should 
         internally assign group and member indexes, so that 
         it can provide read-only access to the group and member 
         tables. This allows MIB monitoring for these types of 
         redundant entities.

         entPhysicalVendorTypes than linecard groups. So each should 
         have a separate ceRedunGroupTypeIndex. 

         For this example, a command line interface may differentiate
         by using separate keywords (port-group versus linecard-group)

         In order to avoid unnecessary collisions between competing

         should give different index values. 
         
         But in order to prevent leaks of unused indexes, it is 
         acceptable to cycle through and report unused indexes again 
         if all of the indexes have already been retrieved previously, 
         yet some remain unused.  So the retrieval of an index 
         should not be considered a permanent longterm reservation.

    STATUS  current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A ceRedunProtectStatusChange notification is sent when a
         protectionProvided bit gets set or cleared for an active
         member. This is intended to allow notification when 
         protection becomes available or unavailable for an active 
         member of a redundancy group.

         It should be suppressed if there's a simultaneous change 
         to the standby bit, which would indicate a switchover 
         trap is being sent.

         Object values sent should reflect the newer status following 
         the change.
