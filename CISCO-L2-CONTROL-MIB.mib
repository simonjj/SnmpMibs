         The entities that will be affected by the action are VLAN, 
         interface or interface-VLAN pair.

         warning : The violation will only generate the notification
         and no further action will be taken.

         limit : The notification will be generated as the 'warning'
         action and also the MAC limit is enforced for the entity.
         It means that the new address will not be learned in the entity
         and the traffic with new addresses will be flooded in the entity. 
         The learning will be re-enabled in the entity  
         if the number of MAC addresses falls below the limit.

         limitNoFlood : The notification will be generated as the
         'warning' action and also the MAC limit is enforced for the
         entity but no flooding traffic for unknown unicast MAC address 
         packets.  It means that the new addresses will not be learned 
         in the entity and also the traffic with new addresses will not
         be flooded in the entity.  The learning will be re-enabled in the 
         entity if the number of MAC addresses falls below the limit.

         shutdown : The notification will be generated as the 'warning'
         action and the system will move the corresponding entity to 
         blocked state, no traffic in the entity. The traffic will be
         re-enabled in the entity if the number of MAC addresses falls

         MAC limit function is to try to control the number of MAC
         addresses for each VLAN or interface or interface-VLAN pair in 
         the forwarding tables for a network device.  It is possible that 
         one VLAN or one interface or interface-VLAN pair can exhaust
         all available MAC entries because of Denial-of-Service
         and cause users' traffic on the other VLANS or interfaces flooded.  
         To prevent this situation, the MAC limit for each VLAN or interface 
         or interface-VLAN pair is needed.  The major function of this 
         feature is to protect the layer 2 forwarding table."
