    DESCRIPTION
            "This is the MIB Module for the Cisco Wireless Radio
             Point to Point experimental components.

    Glossary

    The following terms are used in the MIB definitions below.

    Radio Card: The line card that provides the wireless 
                communication features.
    Radio Link: The bi-directional wireless link that exists 
                between two communicating radio cards.
    Radio PHY:  Represents the transmission characteristics of the 
                Radio Link.
    RF Unit:    The Radio Frequency components and the associated antennas.
    Radio System: Radio card and RF unit(s).


    Cisco Wireless Radio Experimental MIB Organization

    The Cisco Wireless Radio Experimental MIB provides the following
    management groups :

    When the draft-ietf-entmib-v2-03.txt gets finalized the Radio Frequency
    Group will be moved into that MIB.

    When the CISCO-IMAGE-MIB.my gets updated to include the image 
    capabilities, the Image Group will be migrated into that MIB.

    When the CISCO-LED-MIB.my becomes available and supports the 
    functionality the LED group needs, the LED group will be 
    migrated into that.

    o.  Radio Frequency Resource Group
    This contains information about the Radio frequency
    transmission and reception resources available on the
    system. This group determines the portions of the
    radio spectrum at which the radio subsystem can
    operate.
    This group in conjunction with the radio PHY group
    determine the acutal spectrum that gets used for
    communications.

    o.  Image Group      
    This provides facilities to manage radio line card's
    firmware image file URL's in router's image repository.
    It also provides access to the image details.

    o.  LED Group        
    This group provides information about LEDs available
    on the line card.

    o.  Duplexor Group   
    This group provides information about the Duplexors
    installed in the RF resources."

    DESCRIPTION
            "This represents one entry in the cwrRfEntityTable. This table is
            largely a read only table which provides details on the radio 
            frequency resources available on the system. Physically 
            each RF resource may be realized by one antenna and its 
            associated control hardware.
            But a single antenna and its associated hardware may act 
            as more than 1 RF resource.

            A Duplexor is a mechanical device, that acts as a band pass filter
            when installed in an RF resource. 

            Normally a RF resource is capable of operating over a wide 
            frequency range. To operate at restricted frequencies, 
            the user has to own that part of the frequency spectrum.  
            Since the user may not own parts of
            the frequency spectrum over which the RF resource may operate, a
            Duplexor is installed in the RF resource.  This restricts the
            RF resource to operate in the passband defined by the Duplexor.
            In this table the Duplexor's are identified by an index into the
            cwrDuplexorTable. 

            It is indexed by the ifIndex and cwrRfEntityIndex."
