    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those
        devices operating as Central controllers, that
        terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol
        tunnel from Cisco Light-weight LWAPP Access Points.

        Information provided by this MIB is used to study
        the quality of service in the voice and video traffic
        on the WLAN.

        The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs
        can be depicted as follows:

        The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
        the APs.  The MNs communicate with the APs through
        the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.

        LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
        controllers and the controller pushes the configuration,
        that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs.
        The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
        wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
        the LWAPP frames to the controller.

                           GLOSSARY

        Access Point ( AP )

        An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
        control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
        and provides access to the distribution services via
        the wireless medium for associated clients.  

        LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
        LWAPP frames and sends them to the controller to which
        it is logically connected.

        Gratuitous Probe Response (GPR)

        The Gratuitous Probe Response feature aids in conserving
        battery power of WLAN-enabled cell phones by providing
        a high rate packet on the order of tens of milliseconds
        such that these kind of phones can wake up and wait at
        predefined intervals, to reduce battery power.  The 
        GPR packet is transmitted from the AP at a predefined
        time interval.


        Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP )

        This is a generic protocol that defines the 
        communication between the Access Points and the
        Central Controller. 

        Mobile Node ( MN )

        A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
        network associated with an access point. Mobile Node 
        and client are used interchangeably. 

        TU

        A measurement of time in units of 1024 microseconds.

        User Priority ( UP )

        Specifies a the priority rules in QOS for handling user 
        priority.
