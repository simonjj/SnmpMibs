        the overall packaging. A package can still be
        removable if power must be OFF in order to perform
        the removal. If power can be ON and the package
        removed, then the element is removable and can be

        laptop is removable, as is a disk drive package
        inserted using SCA connectors. However, the latter
        can also be hot-swapped. A laptop's display is not
        removable, nor is a non-redundant power supply.
        Removing these components would impact the function
        of the overall packaging, or is impossible due to

        allow the main processor chip to be upgraded to one
        of a higher clock rating. In this case, the
        processor is said to be replaceable. Another
        example is a power supply package mounted on

        However, the latter can be hot-swapped. A laptop's
        display is not removable, nor is a non-redundant

        of a logical device. The Enabled value indicates
        that the power management features are currently

        Entered Automatically indicates that a device can
        change its power state based on usage or other
        criteria. Power State Settable indicates that the
        SetPowerState method is supported. Power Cycling
        Supported indicates that the SetPowerState method
        can be invoked with the PowerState parameter set to
        5 (Power Cycle). Timed Power On Supported indicates
        that the SetPowerState method can be invoked with
        the PowerState parameter set to 5 (Power Cycle) and

        used as an error checking technique where an extra

        by counting the bits that are set.
        
        Value Meaning 
        'None' Parity checking not used 
        'Odd' Sets the parity bit so that the count of bits
        set is an odd number 
        'Even' Sets the parity bit so that the count of
        bits set is an even number 
        'Mark' Leaves the parity bit set to 1 
        'Space' Leaves the parity bit set to 0"
