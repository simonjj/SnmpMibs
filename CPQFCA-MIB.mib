            The status can be:

            Other (1)
              Indicates that the instrument agent does not recognize the
              error code.  You may need to update your software.

              No write cache errors have occurred.

            Bad Configuration (3)
              Indicates that write cache operations are temporarily
              disabled.  The Array Accelerator board was configured for a
              different controller.  This error could be caused if boards
              were switched from one system to another.  Rerun the
              configuration utility and ensurethat the board has been
              properly configured for this system.

            Low Battery Power (4)
              Indicates that write cache operations are temporarily
              disabled due to insufficient battery power.  Please view
              the Battery Status object instance for more information.

            Disable Command Issued (5)
              Indicates that write cache operations are temporarily
              disabled.  The device driver issues this command when
              the server is taken down.  This condition should not
              exist when the system regains power.

            No Resources Available (6)
              Indicates that write cache operations are temporarily
              disabled.  The controller does not have sufficient
              resources to perform write cache operations.
              For example, when a replaced drive is being rebuilt,
              there will not be sufficient resources.  Once the
              operation that requires the resources has completed,
              this condition will clear and write cache operations
              will resume.

            Board Not Connected (7)
              Indicates that write cache operations are temporarily
              disabled.  The Array Accelerator board has been
              configured but is not currently attached to the
              controller. Check the alignment of the board and
              connections.

            Bad Mirror Data (8)
              Indicates that write cache operations have been
              permanently disabled.  The Array Accelerator board stores
              mirrored copies of all data.  If data exists on the

              performs a data compare test between the mirrored copies.
              If the data does not match, an error has occurred.
              Data may have been lost.  Your board may need servicing.

            Read Failure (9)
              Indicates that write cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  The Array Accelerator board stores mirror copies
              of all data.  While reading the data from the board, memory
              parity errors have occurred.  Both copies were corrupted and
              cannot be retrieved.  Data has been lost, and you should
              service the board.

            Write Failure (10)
              Indicates that write cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  This error occurs when an unsuccessful attempt was
              made to write data to the Array Accelerator board.  Data could
              not be written to write cache memory in duplicate due to the
              detection of parity errors.  This error does not indicate data
              loss.  You should service the Array Accelerator board.

            Config Command (11)
              Indicates that write cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  The configuration of the logical drives has changed.
              You need to reconfigure the Array Accelerator board.

            Expand In Progress (12)
              Indicates that cache operations are temporarily disabled
              due to an expand of a logical drive.  When the expand
              operation completes, the accelerator will be enabled.

            Snapshot In Progress (13)
              Indicates that cache operations are temporarily disabled
              due to a snapshot operation that is queued up or in progress.
              When the snapshot operation completes, the accelerator will
              be enabled.

            Redundant Low Battery (14)
              Indicates that cache operations are temporarily disabled.
              The redundant controller has insufficient cache battery power.

              Indicates that cache operations are temporarily disabled.
              The cache on the redundant controller has failed.

            Excessive ECC Errors (17)
              Indicates that write cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  The number of cache lines experiencing excessive
              ECC errors has reached a preset limit.

            Power On Self Test (Post) ECC Errors (19)
              Indicates that write cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  The cache has been disabled due to a large number
              of ECC errors detected while testing the cache during Power
              On Self Test (Post)."

            None (2)
              Fault tolerance is not enabled.  If a physical drive reports
              an error, the data cannot be recovered by the array
              controller.

            Mirroring (3)
              For each physical drive, there is a second physical drive
              containing identical data. If a drive fails, the data can be
              retrieved from the mirror drive.

            Data Guard (4)
              One of the physical drives is used as a data guard drive and
              contains the exclusive OR of the data on the remaining drives.
              If a failure is detected, the External Array Controller
              rebuilds the data using the data guard information plus
              information from the other drives.

            Distributed Data Guard (5)
              Distributed Data Guarding, sometimes referred to as RAID 5,
              is similar to Data Guarding, but instead of storing the parity
              information on one drive, the information is distributed
              across all of the drives.  If a failure is detected, the array
              controller rebuilds the data using the data guard information
              from all the drives.

            Advanced Data Guarding (7)
              Advanced Data Guarding (RAID ADG) is the fault tolerance method
              that provides the highest level of data protection.  It
              'stripes' data and parity across all the physical drives in the
              configuration to ensure the uninterrupted availability of
              uncorrupted data.  This fault-tolerance method is similar to
              distributed data guard (RAID 5) in that parity data is
              distributed across all drives in the array, except in RAID ADG
              the capacity of multiple drives is used to store parity data.
              Assuming the capacity of 2 drives is used for parity data,
              this allows continued operation despite simultaneous failure of
              any 2 drives in the array, whereas RAID 4 and RAID 5 can only
              sustain failure of a single drive."

              is overheating.  The array is still functioning, but
              should be shutdown.

            Shutdown (11)
              Indicates that the storage box that contains the logical drive
              has overheated.  The logical drive is no longer functioning.

            Expanding (12)
              Indicates that the logical drive is currently doing Automatic

            operates if the logical drive is configured in one of the fault
            tolerance modes.

            If the logical drive receives a request while performing
            Auto-Reliability monitoring, the drive will stop monitoring to
            process the request.  Once it has satisfied all incoming requests,
            the drive will wait for the Auto-Reliability delay to expire
            before returning to Auto-Reliability monitoring.

            Auto-Reliability monitoring is a process to insure the highest
            level of data reliability.  In this process each disk is scanned
            to verify that all of the sectors in the array are readable.
            If the Auto-Reliability monitoring process detects any bad
            sectors on the drives, it automatically remaps these bad sectors
            where possible.

            If the value cannot be determined or is not applicable, the
            value is set to -1."

            "Spin up Time in tenths of seconds.

            This is the time it takes for a physical drive to spin up to full
            speed.

            Disks require time to gain momentum and reach operating speed. As
            cars are tested to go from 0 mph to 60 mph in x number of seconds,
            drive manufacturers have preset expectations for the time it takes
            the drive to spin to full speed. Drives that do not meet these
            expectations may have problems.

            The value may be zero (0) under one of the following conditions:

            *  If you are monitoring a physical drive that is part of the
               monitored system's internal drive array storage, and you use a
               warm boot to reset the monitored system. During a warm boot,
               the drives continue to spin.

            *  If you are monitoring a physical drive in an ProLiant Storage
               System storage and you reset the array but not the ProLiant
               Storage System.
