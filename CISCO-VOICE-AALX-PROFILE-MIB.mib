CiscoAal2ProfileType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
        STATUS      current
        DESCRIPTION
            "In VoATM, an AAL2 profile is used for the parameters 
             of bearer traffic during the call setup between the 
             call agent and the media gateway. 

             In AAL2 profile negotiation, some call agents provide
             the profile, some do not. If the AAL2 profile in the 
             call setup is not provided by the call agent, the 
             gateway can select its own configured AAL2 profiles.

             Those AAL2 profiles can be ITU standard AAL2 profiles
             or customized AAL2 profiles.
             
             This textual convention defines the profile type which 
             is either standard profile from ITU or customized 
             profile. 

             There are two groups of profile types:
               itu    - ITU standard profiles
               custom - Customized profiles."

CiscoAal2ProfileNumber ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
        STATUS      current
        DESCRIPTION
            "This textual convention defines the profile number.

             A profile contains a set of entries, each entry 
             specifies an encoding format with an UUI (User-to-User
             Indicator) range and length. 
             The profile set defines a mapping that the receiver of an
             AAL2 type 1 packet uses to interpret the the packet 
             contents. 
             (AAL2 has 3 different packet types : type 1: carry voice,
              type 2: not used, type 3: event, alarm.)

             In other words, the profile set defines which encoding 
             format from the profile is being used.

             The following are the legitimate combinations of 
             CiscoAal2ProfileType and CiscoAal2ProfileNumber:
