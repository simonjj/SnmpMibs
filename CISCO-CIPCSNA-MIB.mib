	DESCRIPTION
	      "This is the Management Information Base (MIB) 
       module for objects used to manage the cisco Systems 
       Network Architecture (SNA) support on Cisco Mainframe
       Channel Connection (CMCC) cards, also called the 
       CIP-SNA feature.

       ---------------------------------------------------

       ---------------------------------------------------


       This mib consists of the following tables:
       1) CSNA Administration 
       2) CSNA Operational
       3) CSNA Statistics
       4) Max Sessions Administration
       5) Max Sessions Operational
       8) LLC2/CSNA Connection mapping

The following is a set of IBM channel terminology:
  1) The Channel Subsystem is the way a host performs
      I/O.
  2) A Channel Path is the path to the Channel Control
      Unit.  In the Cisco CMCC environment, this is the 
      path of the channel to the physical router, itself.  
      This path is needed because the physical channel may 
      be directed (switched) through a device called 
      an ESCON director.  The path defined from the 
      host to the Control Unit can be different than 
      the path from the Control Unit to the host.  
      For an in-depth definition of how this number 
      is derived, see the cipCardCsnaAdminPath object.
  3) A Sub-Channel and Device are exactly the same
      thing.  The term Sub-Channel was introduced
      for ESCON (IBM's serial fiber optic) channel
      interface.  Previously the term Device was used,
      and it mapped directly to hardware (in most
      situations) via a Parallel Channel Adapter
      (PCA). Another name for PCA is Bus & Tag.  In
      the Cisco CMCC environment, the Sub-Channel is
      controlled by the Channel Systems Network
      Architecture (CSNA) feature. For an
      in-depth definition of how this number is
      derived, see the cipCardCsnaAdminDevice object.
      NOTE:  The terminology of Sub-Channel and
      Sub-Channel Index are two completely different
      entities!  See below for Sub-Channel Index.
  4) An I/O Device is the entity that is addressed by
      the combination of Sub-Channel and Device.  This
      directly maps to the cipCardCsnaAdminTable.
      NOTE:  The Channel Systems Network Architecture 
      (CSNA) feature may have multiple  
      sub-channels/devices defined for its control.
      Also NOTE:  That we have defined an object with
      the name cipCardSubChannelIndex and this object
      is the two hex octet Channel Path values concatenated
      with the second hex (the first octet is not used)
      octet Device value and then converted to an
      INTEGER (Unsigned).
      The exact description is taken from the
      CISCO-CHANNEL-MIB
      cipCardSubChannelIndex     OBJECT-TYPE
           SYNTAX      INTEGER
           MAX-ACCESS  read-only
           STATUS      current
           DESCRIPTION
            This indicates which subchannel is being referenced
             for a particular daughter board on a CMCC card.
             This value is constructed as follows:
               path * 256 + device
             Path and device are the values in
             CipCardClawConfigTable.
           ::= { cipCardSubChannelEntry 1 }
       In this mib, the last two lines change to
        Path and device are the values in the
         cipCardCsnaAdminTable.
  5) XCA Major Nodes.  The XCA major node binds the
      Channel Path (from the hosts perspective)/Sub-
      Channel number (i.e. I/O Device), to a CIP internal
      LAN Adapter of a specific type with a unique SAP
      Number.  That same I/O Device can also be
      bound to the same LAN Adapter of the same
      type with a different SAP, and/or the same I/O
      Device can be bound to any other Adapter and
      any unique SAP on that Adapter.  The binding
      allows the I/O Device to talk to the Adapter.
      The SAP allows multiple connections to the
      same Adapter.

The following is an example of the hardware with
the above names showing there locations.

             |----- Channel Path ------|

   -----------------------------------------

The first table is the Cisco Mainframe Channel Connection
  (CMCC) Channel Systems Network Architecture support (CSNA) 
  Administration table.  Each entry created in this table 
  will create an I/O Device that can be attached to the 
  host (via a host VTAM XCA Major Node command).
  The indices of the table are:
   * The CMCC Card Slot Index
   * The Daughter Board Index
   * The Sub-Channel Index
     NOTE:  In the above discussion, this value is defined
            to be a combination of the Channel Path and
            Device (really the address of an I/O Device).
  The fields included in this table represent:
   * Channel Path
   * Device
     NOTE:  The two fields above are the same values as
            the above Sub-Channel Index.
   * The configured maximum block delay time
   * The configured suggested block delay length
   * The configured maximum block length
     NOTE:  The channel uses data blocks that accumulate
            data before it sends it to the host.
   * The row control variable
  In the example above, three entries would be
  defined.
  The first entry would be:
    - CMCC Card Slot 0
    - CMCC Daughter Board 0
    - Sub-Channel Index of 0x150F00 or 1380096
    - Channel Path of 0x150F or 5391
    - Device of 00
    - rest can be defaulted
  The second entry would be:
    - CMCC Card Slot 0
    - CMCC Daughter Board 0
    - Sub-Channel Index of 0x190A00 or 1640960
    - Channel Path of 0x190A or 6410
    - Device of 00
    - rest can be defaulted
  The third entry would be:
    - CMCC Card Slot 0
    - CMCC Daughter Board 1
    - Sub-Channel Index of 0x010000 or 65536
    - Channel Path of 0x0100 or 256
    - Device of 00
    - rest can be defaulted

The next table is an augmented table to the first table.
  It keeps the operational status of the first table.
  The indices are the same as the first table.
  The fields included in this table represent:
    * The current operational state of a this table entry
    * The current operational maximum block delay time
    * The current operational suggested block delay length
    * The current operational maximum block length
  In the example above, three entries would be
  defined.
  The first entry would be:
    - CMCCC Card Slot 0
    - CMCC Daughter Board 0
    - Sub-Channel Index of 0x150F00 or 1380096
    - rest will be determined by the agent
  The second entry would be:
    - CMCC Card Slot 0
    - CIP Daughter Board 0
    - Sub-Channel Index of 0x190A00 or 1640960
    - rest will be determined by the agent
  The second entry would be:
    - CMCC Card Slot 0
    - CMCC Daughter Board 1
    - Sub-Channel Index of 0x010000 or 65536
    - rest will be determined by the agent

The next table is an augmented table to the first table.
  It keeps the statistics for the Channel Systems Network
  Architecture (CSNA) counters.
  The indices are the same as the first table.
  The fields included in this table represent:
    * Blocks transmitted
    * Blocks received
    * Bytes transmitted
    * Bytes received
    * Blocks transmitted by maximum block delay time
    * Blocks transmitted by the suggested block delay length
    * Blocks transmitted by maximum block length
  In the example above, three entries would be
  defined.
  The first entry would be:
    - CMCC Card Slot 0
    - CMCC Daughter Board 0
    - Sub-Channel Index of 0x150F00 or 1380096
    - rest will be determined by the agent
  The second entry would be:
    - CMCC Card Slot 0
    - CMCC Daughter Board 0
    - Sub-Channel Index of 0x190A00 or 1640960
    - rest will be determined by the agent
  The second entry would be:
    - CMCC Card Slot 0
    - CMCC Daughter Board 1
    - Sub-Channel Index of 0x010000 or 65536
    - rest will be determined by the agent

The next table is maximum sessions Admin table.
  The one entry in this table defines the configured
  maximum sessions supported on the whole CMCC card.
  The one index is:
    * The ifIndex addresses the virtual CMCC interface
  The one field in this table represents:
    * The maximum sessions for this card
  In the example above, the one entry would be defined.
    - ifIndex is created by the agent
    - the maximum sessions would be within the
      range

The next table is the operational maximum sessions table.
  This table is an augmented table to the maximum sessions
  Admin table.  The entries in this table display the 
  current maximum sessions supported on the whole CMCC card. 
  The indices are the same as the maximum sessions Admin
  table.
  The one field in this table represents:
    * The current operational maximum sessions for
      this card
  In the example above, the one entry would be defined.
    - ifIndex is created by the agent
    - the maximum sessions would be within the
      range

The next table is the statistical maximum sessions table.
  This table is an augmented table to the maximum sessions
  Admin table.  The entries in this table displays the 
  current high water maximum sessions supported on the 
  whole CMCC card and the number of allocation errors that 
  have occurred when attempting to increase the number of 
  sessions. The indices are the same as the maximum sessions
  Admin table.
  The one field in this table represents:
    * The current operational maximum sessions for
      this card
  In the example above, the one entry would be defined.
    - ifIndex is created by the agent
    - the highest maximum sessions that has occurred since
      the last re-boot.
    - the number of allocation errors when extending the
      number of sessions.

The last table is the SNA Connection table.  Each entry
  in this table represents a connection from an I/O Device
  (Channel Path/Device) address to a CMCC internal LAN Adapter
  for a single SAP address. Multiple entries in this table
  can represent the same LAN Adapter with the use
  of a different SAP.  The entries in this table are
  created when VTAM on a host creates an XCA Major
  Node definition.  That definition will tell the router
  what I/O Device address are to be bound to which
  CMCC internal LAN Adapter (of a type) and which SAP will be
  used to carry traffic.
  The indices of the table are:
    * The ifIndex that addresses the virtual
      CMCC interface
    * The virtual interface identifying a unique
      CMCC internal MAC Adapter. This definition used is defined
      in the CISCO-SNA-LLC-MIB as llcPortVirtualIndex.
    * The SAP used by this connection.
      NOTE:  The SAP definition used is defined in
             the CISCO-SNA-LLC-MIB.
  The fields included in this table represent:
    * The number of currently active sessions 
      over this connection
    * The slot of the CMCC card.
    * The port on the CMCC card that the Path/Device
      (subchannel is configured.
    * The Channel Path used by this connection
    * The Device used by this connection
  In the example above, the number entries would
  depend upon the VTAM configuration.
  Each entry would be:
    - ifIndex is created by the agent
    - one of the LAN identifiers from one of the entries
      in the CMCC internal LAN table. 
    - one of the adapter identifiers from one the
      entries in the CMCC internal LAN Adapter table.
    - the SAP provided by the XCA Major Node command
    - the number of currently active sessions
    - the slot of the CMCC card.
    - the port on the CMCC card.
    - the Channel Path from one entry in the first table
    - the Device from same entry as the Channel Path
      in the first table

  STATUS        current
  DESCRIPTION
      "This channel path is a two octet value made up of the
       following values:
       ------------------------------------------------------
       Path  01-FF
                    For a directly attached ESCON channel or
                    any parallel channel, this value is 01
                    unless the system administrator has
                    configured another value.
                    For a channel attached through an ESCON
                    director switch, this value will be the
                    path that, from the router point of view,
                    exits the switch and attaches to the
                    host.
       ------------------------------------------------------
       Channel logical address  0-F
                    For a directly attached ESCON channel or
                    any parallel channel, this value is 0.
                    If the host is running in Logical
                    Partition (LPAR) mode, this is the
                    channel logical address associated with
                    the channel and defined in the IOCP
                    configuration file used by VTAM.
                    The default for this part of the path
                    argument is 0.
                    Otherwise, the channel logical address
                    associated with the channel is defined
                    in the IOCP configuration file used by
                    VTAM.
       ------------------------------------------------------
       Control unit logical address    0-F
                    For a directly attached ESCON channel or
                    any parallel channel, this value
                    defaults to 0. If this value is
                    specified in the IOCP file, used by
                    VTAM, then match that value here.
                    Otherwise, the control unit logical
                    address is specified in the IOCP
                    configuration file's CNTLUNIT statement
                    for the host channel in the CUADD parameter.
       ------------------------------------------------------
       For example, for path C7, channel logical address 9, control
       unit logical address 4, the 2 octet value is C7:94.
