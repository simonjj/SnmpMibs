         External AIS - is an Alarm Indication Signal associated
         with a maintenance alarm detected on a defective 
         maintenance span, that is transmitted in the direction 
         of the defect as a substitute for normal signal. 
         The purpose is to show the downstream  entities that 
         a defect has been identified and to prevent other 
         maintenance alarms consequent to this first defect.
         External AIS bit stream is represented by an all 1's 
         signal. 
         Ref - ITU-T Rec. M.20 sec. 5.4.2 a 

         External RAI - is a Remote Alarm Indication signal 
         that is transmitted upstream from an entity that has 
         detected defects persisting long enough to constitute 
         a received signal failure. Its purpose is to report in 
         the backward direction that there is an interruption 
         of service in the forward direction.
         The forward direction is from the originating end of
         the alarm to the remote end.
         The backward direction is from the remote end to the
         orginating end of the alarm.
         Ref - ITU-T Rec. G.704 section 2.1.3.1.3 
               I.366.2 - ANNEX N

         External Connection AIS - is a Alarm Indicating Signal 
         transmitted in the downstream direction from the AAL 
         type 2 connecting point that first detects a defect 
         affecting the AAL type 2 connection; this includes 
         defects indicated by lower layers.
         Ref - ITU-T Rec. I.610 sec 6.2.2.1.1.1 

         External Connection RDI -  is a signal transmitted upstream 
         by an AAl type 2 endpoint that is in an alarm state as the 
         result of having received an AAL type2 connection AIS or 
         having detected a defect that affects the AAL type2 
         connection. 

         All ATM alarm definitions are specified in I.610 
         (ITU standard).
