    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module manages the Gateway GPRS Support
        Node (GGSN) devices. 

        A GGSN device provides interworking with external 
        packet-data network of a particular GPRS service
        provider. It provides a combination of IP routing
        and GPRS specific functionality to support mobile
        users.

        GTP version1 is introduced in  UMTS release 99 and
        Cisco GGSN will support both GTP version 1 (GTP v1)
        and version zero (GTP v0) simultaneously. 

        GTP v1 supports multiple PDP contexts sharing one 
        IP address.  TFTs are introduced to achieve this.
        Each TFT is associated with a PDP context and there
        may exist one PDP context without TFT amongst all 
        PDP contexts sharing the same IP address. Each TFT 
        has one to eight packet filters each assigned with
        a precedence index.  These packet filters are 
        evaluated one at a time against the packet header 
        information in sequence of their precedence index.
        A match is claimed if all the filters are matched
        and the PDP context that the TFT belongs to will be
        selected, else the checks are performed against the 
        filters of another PDP context.  If the packet 
        header doesn't contain any TFT packet filter
        information, then the PDP context without the TFT is 
        selected for further processing.

        Note on notifications:

        When an alarm occurs on the device, if the alarm's
        severity is higher than the severity filter threshold,
        a notification is generated by the device; and if
        cGgsnNotifEnabled is 'true', then the device's
        SNMP-engine configuration will be searched to
        determine where to send the notification.

        for an already active context. If a new Create PDP Context 
        Request is incoming on TEID 0 for an already active PDP 
        context, this Create PDP Context Request must be considered 
        related to a new session. The existing PDP context shall be 
        torn down locally, and the associated PDP contexts deleted 
        locally, before the new session is created. If a new Create 
        PDP Context Request is incoming on a TEID which is different 
        from 0 and this TEID is already allocated to one or more 
        activated PDP contexts, and the NSAPI IE value in this message
        matches the NSAPI value of an active PDP context, the GGSN 
        shall send back a Create PDP Context Response with a rejection 
        cause code. It is implementation dependent deciding whether 
        to teardown or keep the existing PDP context.

        to route IP packets beyond MS. This works only if a static
        route is added in GGSN to the node beyond the MS.

        On enabling this feature, GGSN will route the packets in
        both process switch path and cef switch path. This is 
        supported only for IP PDP type.

        This feature has some limitations:
        - This is not scalable, since the operator has to add static
          route to all the node beyond the MS.
        - Only works for MS having static address.
        - In case of GTPv1 the MS has to select TFT's so as to allow
          traffic flow in the downlink direction.
        - IP address assignment/Radius for the devices behind the MS 
          needs to be done within the scope of that network; the GGSN 
          will not provide this facility in anyway for the hosts 
          behind the MS. 
        - In case for MWAM and Cat6500/7600 environment, the static 
          route should be added only on that particular GGSN on the 
          MWAM from where the MS is reachable.
