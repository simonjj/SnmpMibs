        DESCRIPTION
            "This is the Cisco fibre element management MIB module.
             It covers:
             - Cisco extension to the interface MIB ( IF-MIB )
             - Contains all the groups from FIBRE-CHANNEL-FE-MIB
               relevant to Cisco fabric.
             - Other features specific to Cisco fabric.

             This MIB supports all the port types defined by the
             textual convention FcPortTypes. In addition it also
             supports Nx_port, where Nx_port can be either N_port or
             NL_port. The FC standards define Interconnect_Ports
             to be E_ports or B_Ports.

             This MIB supports Port Channel ports. Port 
             Channel port is a single logical port, which contains 
             multiple physical ports as its members. Presently only 
             E_ports can be a member of Port Channel port.

             In addition it provides GigE and port channel information 
             for all the Gigabit Ethernet (GigE) ports in the fabric."

                         failure.
                     'errorDisabled(5)' - the port is not operational 
                         due to some error conditions that require

                         transmiting an reconfigure fabric, requesting
                         a disruptive reconfiguration in an attempt to 
                         build a single, non-isolated fabric.
                     Only the Interconnect_Ports can become isolated. 
                     'elpFailureIsolation(17)' - during a port 
                         initialization the prospective 
                         Interconnect_Ports find incompatible link

                     'escFailureIsolation(18) - during a port 
                         initialization the prospective 
                         Interconnect_Ports are unable to proceed with
                         initialization as a result of Exchange Switch
                         Capabilities (ESC).
                     'domainOverlapIsolation(19)' - there is a overlap 
                         in domains while attempting to connect two
                         existing fabrics.
                     'domainAddrAssignFailureIsolation(20)' - the 
                         elected principal switch is not capable of
                         performing domain address manager functions so
                         no Nx_port traffic can be forwarded across
                         switches, hence all Interconnect_Ports in the
                         switch are isolated.
                     'domainOtherSideEportIsolation(21)' - the peer 
                         e-port is isolated.

                         interface is bound is down.

        their state changed to 'outOfService'. Examples of 
        such shared resources include speed/bandwidth and

        of the following objects:

       When an attempt is made to change a particular 
       interface's value for this object to 'outOfService':
          - if the interface's ifAdminStatus is 'up' or if the
            interface is a part of a Port channel, then the 
            change to the value of this object is rejected.
          - if the interface's value of this object is 
            successfully changed to 'outOfService', then each 
            and every user-configured parameter value of the 
            above-listed shared resource objects for that 
            interface is set to its default value.

       When an interface is in the 'outOfService' state then:
          - the interface is not operational and no packets 
            can be passed,
          - the interface's shared resource objects can not be
            configured to non-default values,
          - the interface cannot be added to a port channel.
          - the interface cannot be involved in a port swap 
            (using cficonPortSwapTable in CISCO-FICON-MIB).
          - ifAdminStatus in IF-MIB cannot be changed to 'up' 
            state.
          - other interface objects are not affected.

       Changing the value of this object on one interface to
       'outOfService' does not affect the functionality of any 
       other interface.
 
       When an attempt is made to change a particular interface's
       value for this object to 'inService', the attempt is 
       rejected if necessary shared resources are unavailable."
