        DESCRIPTION
            "This is the MIB module for Usage Based Metering for the
             DOCSIS-compliant Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS).
 
             Usage Based Metering is a software feature provided in the
             CMTS so that cable operators can perform subscriber 
             account management and metering in a uniform and 
             consistent manner. 
             It involves the implementation of Subscriber Account 
             Management Interface Specification (SAMIS) as defined by 
             DOCSIS-OSSI specification. Usage-Based Metering is 
             essential in the processing of bills based on services 
             rendered to and consumed by paying subscribers. The SAMIS 
             specification focuses primarily on bandwidth centric 
             usage-based metering scenarios.
             The DOCSIS 1.1 RFI specification provides a mechanism for 
             a Cable Modem (CM) to register with its Cable Modem 
             Termination System (CMTS) and to configure itself based 
             on external Quality of Service (QoS) parameters when it 
             is powered up or reset. The principal mechanism for 
             providing enhanced QoS is to classify packets traversing 
             the RF MAC interface into a Service Flow. 
             A Service Flow is a unidirectional flow of packets that is
             provided a particular Quality of Service. 

             The mediation system can then rate the charges differently 
             for each of the Service Flow traffic counts based on 
             its Service Class. Thus, the mediation system obtains from 
             the CMTS the traffic counts for each named Service Flow 
             (identified by SFID) that a subscribers CM uses during 
             the metering data collection interval. The Usage Based 
             Metering requirement is that the CMTS must be able to 
             provide formatted Subscriber Usage 
             Metering Records for all subscribers attached to the CMTS,
             on demand to an external collection system. Optionally, 
             the metering records can be stored locally so that it is 
             available via ftp to the external collection server.

             The CMTS provides two configuration options to handle the
             export of metering data.
             Local :
             Store the record locally on the CMTS after collection. The
             metering system should then(operating at its own schedule)
             take the file out of the CMTS and is also responsible for
             deletion of the local file on the CMTS.  The deletion of 
             the file is an indication to the metering collector to 
             start construction of the new metering record which will 
             then be written to the local filesystem and the cycle 
             continues.

             Streaming: 
             Stream the records to an external collection system as
             they get generated.  The time interval in which the record
             will be generated is configurable at the CMTS. A secure 
             and reliable stream is used to transport the metering 
             record out of the CMTS. 
             In case the connection to external metering system is 
             not possible, CMTS will retry establishing channel for a 
             max specified times. 

             The MIB allows for configuration of the parameters that 
             control the metering record collection like interval, 
             amount of metering information required, location or IP 
             address of the collection server, and metering filename. 
             In addition it provides for some important notificatons to
             the NMS to indicate the success/failure of the 
             metering collection."
