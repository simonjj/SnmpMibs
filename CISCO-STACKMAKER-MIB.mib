 	DESCRIPTION
 		" A descriptive string used by the network administrator
 		one stack at any given time. If this entry is empty,
 		the device is not a member of a stack.
 
 		Changing the value of this object will move the device
 		to a different stack. If the value is cleared, the device
 		is no longer a member of any stack."

 	STATUS          current
 	DESCRIPTION
 		"This object is used to clear the csmStackTable
 		with a single SNMP operation. The application will clear
 		the table and re-write the table to accommodate new
 		or modified table entries.
 		Setting this object to noClearTable has no effect.
 		The agent will always return the value of noClearTable
 		when this object is read."

 	STATUS          current
 	DESCRIPTION
 		"The table of IP addresses for the devices which are
 		members of the stack. Individual entries can be added
 		to the table to add devices in the stack either through
 		SNMP Set operations or through the device's command line
 		interface. However, the agent need not support deletion
 		of individual entries, since the table is first cleared
 		before any modifications are made, using the
 		csmClearStackTable object. The agent will return
 		the error badValue if an SNMP Set operation is
 		attempted on an existing row.
 		
 		It is the responsibility of the network administrator to
 		ensure that a device does not belong to more than one stack
 		and to maintain referential integrity across devices. A
 		device will take no action upon the information stored in
 		this table other than to guarantee its persistence over
 		device reboots."
