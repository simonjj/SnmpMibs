    DESCRIPTION
            "This MIB module manages the GPRS Tunnelling Protocol
            (GTP) on GGSN and SGSN.

            GPRS provides wireless access to packet data network on
            the GSM infrastructure.

            The following diagram illustrates a simplified GPRS
            logical architecture with the name of inter-node
            interface:

            GTP is the protocol between GSN nodes (GSN peers) in
            the GPRS backbone network. It includes both the GTP
            signalling and data transfer procedures.

            GTP is used both on the Gn interface, i.e. the interface
            between GSN peers with in a PLMN, and the Gp
            interface between GSN peers in different PLMNs.

            SGSN is the serving GPRS support node, it responsible 
            for the delivery of data packets from and to the MS 
            within its service area.

            GGSN is the gateway GPRS support node, it provides 
            interworking with external PDN and is connected with 
            SGSNs via an IP-based GPRS backbone network.

            The GTP protocol is implemented only by SGSNs and GGSN.

            A PDP Context is an information set maintained by MS 
            and GSNs which describes the mobile wireless service
            call or session.

            A Qos Profile is associated with each PDP context which
            defines multiple attributes like precedence, delay, 
            reliability, peak throughput and mean throughput.
            Based on the precedence, delay and mean throughput an
            user is classified into one of the three Qos classes:
            Best Effort, Normal and Premium.

            Mean throughput is measured at the Gi and R reference 
            points in units of octets per second. It specifies the 
            average rate at which data is expected to be 
            transferred across the GPRS network during the 
            remaining lifetime of an activated PDP context.

            A MAP converting GSN is responsible for converting GTP
            messages to and from MAP messages.  This helps in the
            communication with HLR.

    REVISION        "200109131535Z"
    DESCRIPTION
            "Modified the default value for cGtpMaximumPdps from
            1000 to 10000.

            Added 'gtpdirector' to the enumeration of cGtpService.

            The APN identifies whether the network is corporate 
            or service provider network.  

            The Single Access point feature enables the
            service provider to add new access-points to the GGSN
            without having to provision the HLR. The requests are
            sent by the SGSN to the same virtual APN. A virtual
            APN is not associated with any actual physical
            network.  The GGSN processes the request and forwards
            the packet to the appropriate access-point that is
            specified in the PCO. This feature is supported only
            in Cisco GGSNs.

            The purpose of the GTP-Director is to provide a
            mechanism for service providers using non-Cisco GGSN
            to use the Single APN feature.

            The GTP-Director also provides load balancing, using 
            round robin mechanism, across GGSNs.  The
            Cisco GGSNs may use the GTP-Director, but is not
            necessary as they can use IOS-SLB ( Server Load
            Balancing ).
