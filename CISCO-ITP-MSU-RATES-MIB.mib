        DESCRIPTION
           "This MIB provides information used to manage the number
            of MTP3 MSUs transmitted and received per processor.  Many
            of the higher level protocols require several MSUs per 
            transaction.  Traffic capacity planning is based on MSUs
            not transactions.  This MIB will provide information to 
            determine current traffic.
                
            The Cisco IP Transfer Point (ITP) is a hardware and 
            software solution that transports SS7 traffic using
            IP.  Each ITP node provides function similar to SS7 
            signalling point.
            
            The relevant ITU documents describing this technology
            is the ITU Q series, including ITU Q.700: Introduction
            to CCITT Signalling System No. 7 and ITU Q.701 
            Functional description of the message transfer part
            (MTP) of Signalling System No. 7.

    DESCRIPTION
        "This table provides information associated with each 
         processor.  Thresholds are provided to control the

         cimrMsuTrafficTable table.

         -- cimrMsuProcDurOverloaded       
         
         Any changes to these thresholds will cause a reset of
         measurements which is indicated by cimrMsuProcReset
         and cimrMsuProcResetTimestamp objects.

         Notifications thresholds.
         In order to generate notifications when MSU rate switch
         states the customer must define traffic levels using the
         following objects.  When the global objects contain 
         non-zero values they will act as defaults to all entries 
         in table.  
         
         global:
         - cimrMsuRateAcceptableThreshold 
         - cimrMsuRateWarningThreshold    
         - cimrMsuRateOverloadedThreshold 
          
         Per processor: 
         - cimrMsuProcAcceptableThreshold 
         - cimrMsuProcWarningThreshold    
         - cimrMsuProcOverloadedThreshold
         
         The global thresholds only apply when all of the threshold
         objects at instance level are set to zero.  Set operations 
         against thresholds must be performed as single operation.
         
         Calculation of cimrMsuTrafficRateState object is performed in 
         the following manner to only report significant changes
         in traffic.  In order to switch to a higher state the 
         traffic rate must equal or exceed the next higher 
         threshold.  For example when current state is acceptable
         the traffic must equal or exceed value specified by 
         warning-threshold to obtain warning state.  In order to
         switch to a lower state the traffic rate must be less than
         the next lower threshold.  For example when current state 
         is overloaded the traffic must drop below warning-threshold
         to obtain warning state.
         
         Example:
         Acceptable-Threshold = 2000
         Warning-Threshold    = 2500
         Overloaded-Threshold = 3000
         
         Sample  Rate  Old State     New State
         ------  ----  ----------    ----------
              1  2000  Acceptable    Acceptable
              2  2500  Acceptable    Warning
              3  2200  Warning       Warning
              4  2000  Warning       Acceptable
              5  3000  Acceptable    Overloaded

cimrMsuTrafficTable OBJECT-TYPE

    MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This table provides information on the traffic in MUS 
         for each processor in both directions.  Any MSU in which
         a processor is involved will be counted.  Here are some 
         examples of how MSUs would be counted.
        
         Traditional SS7 Links:
         MSU is received on Line card 1 that supports SS7 link and
         MSU is routed directly to line card 2 that supports output
         link.  Line card 1 processor information will be updated to
         indicate it received MSU  and line card 2 processor 
         information will be updated to indicate it sent MSU.
     
         IP/SCTP based SS7 Links:
         IP based SS7 Links can be terminated on linecard or owned 
         by the main processor.  When SS7 link is terminated on main
         processor only the main processor information will be 
         updated.  The line card processor that owns the IP interface 
         will be involved but will not be included in measurements.
         When the SS7 link is terminated on line card its processor
         information will be updated.
   
         It is important to note that packets exchanged for SCTP 
         associations are different from SS7 MSUs.  More than one 
         SS7 MSU can be transmitted in a single IP packet.  Also,
         the SCTP association exchanges control packets that are
         not counted as SS7 MSUs.
