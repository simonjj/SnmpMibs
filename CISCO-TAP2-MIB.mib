                This MIB replaces CISCO-TAP-MIB. This MIB defines
                a generic stream table that contains fields common to
                all intercept types. Specific intercept filters are
                defined in extension MIBs. They are CISCO-IP-TAP-MIB
                for IP intercepts, CISCO-802-TAP-MIB for IEEE 802
                intercepts and CISCO-USER-CONNECTION-TAP-MIB for
                RADIUS-based user connection intercepts."

        "The Intercept Stream Table lists the traffic streams to be 
        intercepted. The same data stream may be required by multiple 
        taps, and one might assume that often the intercepted stream 
        is a small subset of the traffic that could be intercepted.


        The Table consists of generic fields that are independent
        of the type of intercept. It contains type of the specific 
        filter which is defined in an extension MIB and counters to 
        account for packets intercepted or dropped by the attached
        filter specification.

        Note that the Mediation Device must make sure there is 
        only one type of specific filter created with the same 
        indices as that of a row in this table, otherwise the 
        later creations will fail. For example, if there is a 
        row in this table with index 1.2, there can be a 
        corresponding row with the same index either in 
        citapStreamTable, c8tapStreamTable or cuctTapStreamTable,
        but not all. 


        The first index indicates which Mediation Device the
