    DESCRIPTION
            "This is the MIB Module for the Cisco Wireless Radio
            Point to MultiPoint interface link metrics
            specification.

    Glossary

    The following terms are used in the MIB definitions below.

    Radio Interface:  The interface that provides wireless communication
                      features.
    Radio Link:       The bi-directional wireless link between two
                      communicating wireless radios.
    Radio PHY:        Represents the transmission characteristics of the
                      Radio link.

    Link Admin Up:    This is the system time when the link is configured
                      to be 'administratively up'. The user can configure
                      the link to be up either by executing a 'no shut'
                      command via the CLI or by setting the ifAdminStatus
                      object in the IF-MIB to 'up(1)' via SNMP.

    Cisco Wireless MIB Organization

    The Cisco Wireless Point to Multipoint Radio Link Metrics MIB is
    divided into 2 main groups.

    Head End:        These objects are supported on the Head End only.
    Subscriber Unit: These objects are supported on the Subscriber
                     unit only."

-- Definitions:

-- Codeword Error:
-- A codeword with errors in it, that could NOT be corrected.
-- A codeword that cannot be corrected is dropped so reducing the
-- total data throughput.

-- Error Free Second (CwrCwErrorFreeSecond):
-- A Codeword Error Free Second (EFS) is defined as a second when
-- the radio link was synchronized and no codeword errors detected
-- on the link.

-- Errored Second (CwrCwErroredSecond):
-- A Codeword Errored Second (ES) is defined as a second when the
-- radio link was synchronized and 1 or more codeword errors were
-- detected on the link.

-- Severely Errored Second (CwrCwSeverelyErroredSecond):
-- A Codeword Severely Errored Second (SES) is defined as a second
-- when the radio link was synchronized and the number of codeword
-- errors received was greater than the threshold specified by
-- p2mpSuLinkSESThresh.

-- An Available second:
-- Is defined to be 1 second during which the link was available
-- for data transmission/reception. It is equal to:
-- Error Free Seconds + Errored Seconds - Severely Errored Seconds.

-- Sync Loss Seconds:
-- The time in seconds for the two ends of the link to synchronize
-- after the link is configured administratively

-- Unavailable Seconds:
-- Represent the number of seconds that the user wanted the link
-- to be available but was not. It is equal to:
-- Severely Errored Seconds + Sync Loss Seconds.

-- Link Up Seconds :
-- Interval in seconds, between the time the link was
-- administratively configured up and when it was
-- administratively configured down. It is equal to:
-- Available Seconds + Unavailable Seconds.

-- An Operational Second :
-- Is defined as a second during which the ends of a radio link are
-- synchronized and ready for duplex communication.

-- An Operational Hour :
-- Is 3600 operational seconds.

-- Degraded Second (CwrCwDegradedSecond):
-- A Codeword Degraded Second (DS) is defined as a 1 second
-- interval during which the number of codeword errors was between
-- cwrLinkLowCwErrThresh and cwrLinkHighCwErrThresh.

-- Consecutively Severely Errored Second (CwrCwConsecutiveSevErrSecond):
-- A Codeword Consecutively Severely Errored Seconds (CSES) is
-- defined as the metric that measures the number of times a
-- sequence of Codeword Severely Errored Seconds(SES) crosses the
-- cwrLinkCSESThresh value.  It is independent of the length of the
-- SES sequence.  In other words this counter is incremented by one
-- and only one for every such occurrence.
-- This metric measures the stability of the link i.e. if this
-- count is high, it implies that the link is oscillating between
-- usable v/s unusable extremes.


-- This section contains the following information:

-- o) Link Metric Thresholds. This table provides facilities to
-- establish thresholds that control the collection of the link
-- metrics.

-- o) Cumulative link metrics. This table provides cumulative
-- metrics about the link since the last reboot of the radio
-- card.

-- o) 1 Hour Metrics. This includes cumulative values of the
-- metrics for every hour for a maximum duration of 24 hours.
-- The information in table is identical to the information in
-- the 1 Minute Metrics except that the data has been
-- aggregated over 1 hour.

-- o) 1 Minute Metrics. This includes cumulative values of the
-- every minute for a maximum duration of 60 minutes.

-- o) 1 Second Metrics. This table includes updates received from
-- hardware over the last 1 second. This contains hardware
-- reported information cumulated over 1 second.
