    DESCRIPTION
        "The Win32_DriverVXD WMI class represents a virtual
        device driver on a Windows computer system. A
        virtual device is a program that manages a system
        resource (such as a hardware device or installed
        software) so that more than one application can use
        the resource at the same time. Windows uses virtual
        devices to allow multitasking for Windows-based
        applications. The virtual devices work in
        conjunction with Windows to process interrupts, and
        carry out I/O operations for a given application
        without disrupting the execution of other
        applications.
        
        Most virtual devices manage a hardware device and
        many also manage or replace corresponding software
        such as ROM BIOS routines. A virtual device can
        contain the device-specific code needed to carry
        out actions on the device or it can rely on the
        other software to carry out these operations. In
        all cases, the virtual device keeps track of the
        state of the device for each application and
        ensures that the device is in the correct state
        whenever an application continues execution.
        
        Some virtual devices manage only installed
        software, such as an MS-DOS device driver or a
        Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program. Such
        virtual devices often contain code that either
        emulates the software or ensures that the software
        uses data that applies only to the currently
        running application. Virtual devices are sometimes
        used to improve the performance of installed
        software; the Intel-compatible microprocessors can
        execute the 32-bit code of a virtual device more
        efficiently than the 16-bit code of an MS-DOS
        device driver or TSR."

        several components. Unique CIM_System keys are
        required, but you can define a heuristic to create
        the CIM_ComputerSystem name that generates the same
        name, and is independent from the discovery
        protocol. This prevents inventory and management
        problems when the same asset or entity is
        discovered multiple times, but cannot be resolved
        to one object. Using a heuristic is recommended but
        not required.
        The heuristic is outlined in the CIM V2 Common
        Model specification, and assumes that the
        documented rules are used to determine and assign a
        name. The NameFormat values list defines the order
        to assign a computer system name. Several rules map
        to the same value.
        The CIM_ComputerSystem Name value that is
        calculated using the heuristic is the key value of
        the system. However, you can use aliases to assign
        a different name for CIM_ComputerSystem, which can

        created with the AT command in a command window
        from Start, Run, or from Control Panel, Scheduled
        Jobs. You can enumerate or delete any existing jobs
        that are displayed in the Control Panel, Scheduled
        Jobs dialog box by using the Win32_ScheduledJob
        instances. This class is only instrumented on
        Windows NT 4.0 and later. 
        
        Each job scheduled against the schedule service is
        stored persistently (the scheduler can start a job
        after a reboot), and is executed at the specified
        time and day of the week or month. If the computer
        is not active or if the scheduled service is not
        running at the specified job time, the schedule
        service runs the specified job on the next day at
        the specified time.
        
        Jobs are scheduled according to Universal
        Coordinated Time (UTC) with bias offset from
        Greenwich mean time (GMT), which means that a job
        can be specified using any time zone. The
        Win32_ScheduledJob class returns the local time
        with UTC offset when enumerating an object, and
        converts to local time when creating new jobs. For
        example, a job specified to run on a computer in
        Boston at 10:30 P.M. Monday PST time will be
        scheduled to run locally at 1:30 A.M. Tuesday EST.
        Note that a client must take into account whether
        or not daylight savings time is in operation on the
        local computer, and if it is, then subtract a bias
        of 60 minutes from the UTC offset."
