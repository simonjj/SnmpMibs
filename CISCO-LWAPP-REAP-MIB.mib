    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those
        devices operating as Central Controllers (CC) that
        terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol
        tunnel from Light-weight LWAPP Access Points.

        Information represented by this MIB is passed by the
        controller to those Cisco LWAPP APs, that can
        operate in stand-alone mode.  

        The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs
        can be depicted as follows:

        The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
        the APs.  The MNs communicate with the APs through
        the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.

        LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
        controllers and the controller pushes the configuration,
        that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs.
        The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
        wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
        the LWAPP frames to the controller.

                           GLOSSARY

        Access Point ( AP )

        An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
        control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
        and provides access to the distribution services via
        the wireless medium for associated clients.  

        LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
        LWAPP frames and sends them to the controller to which
        it is logically connected.

        Central Controller ( CC )

        The central entity that terminates the LWAPP protocol
        tunnel from the LWAPP APs.  Throughout this MIB,
        this entity is also referred to as 'controller'.

        Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP ) 

        This is a generic protocol that defines the
        communication between the Access Points and the
        Central Controller.

        Mobile Node ( MN )

        A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
        network associated with an access point.

        Native VLAN ID

        A switch port and/or AP can be configured with a
        'native VLAN ID'.  Untagged or priority-tagged
        frames are implicitly associated with the native
        VLAN ID.  The default native VLAN ID is '1' if
        VLAN tagging is enabled.  The native VLAN ID is '0'
        or 'no VLAN ID' if VLAN tagging is not enabled.

        Remote Edge Access Point ( REAP )

        The LWAPP AP that can also act as a stand-alone AP
        when it loses communication with the controller
        it was associated with.

        When REAP can reach the controller (connected state),
        it gets help from controller to complete client
        authentication. When a controller is not reachable by
        REAP, it goes into standalone state and does client
        authentication by itself.  All data packets from
        clients are either bridged locally (local-switch)
        or forwarded to the controller (central-switch)
        depending on the WLAN configuration.

        Virtual LAN

        VLAN defined in the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN standard
        supports logically segmenting of LAN
        infrastructure into different subnets or
        workgroups so that packets are switched only
        between ports within the same VLAN.

        VLAN ID
        Each VLAN is identified by a 12-bit 'VLAN ID'.
        A VLAN ID of '0' is used to indicate 'no VLAN ID'.
        Valid VLAN IDs range from '1' to '4095'.

        "This table represents the WLAN configuration sent by
        the controller to REAPs so that the APs can operate
        in stand-alone mode.

        LWAPP APs operating in REAP mode locally switch 
        the data frames of the associated clients, rather 
        than tunneling them through to the LWAPP controller 
        as LWAPP data packets.  The LWAPP controller
        passes this configuration set to the LWAPP AP during
        the AP initialization so that the AP can operate
        in stand-alone mode when it fails to reach the
        controller.  The configuration is also passed to
        the REAP when they are individually modified through
        separate LWAPP messages.  The REAP updates itself
        with the information received through these LWAPP
        messages.

        This table has a one-to-one relationship with
        cLWlanConfigTable of the CISCO-LWAPP-WLAN-MIB.  There
        exist a row in this table corresponding to each
        row representing a WLAN in cLWlanConfigTable.

        Note that the configuration represented by this 
        table is applicable only for REAPs.  The 
        controller will send this configuration set only to 
        the REAP APs for their operation in standalone
